# manufacturing-inventory-app

This is an inventory management system developed in Java that allows the user to manage parts and products in a graphical user interface (GUI). The GUI is built using JavaFX and includes multiple forms for adding, modifying, and deleting parts and products.

## User Interface

The application's UI includes the following forms:

- Main form
- Add Part form
- Modify Part form
- Add Product form
- Modify Product form

Javadoc comments have been provided for each class member throughout the code, including details on how any logical or runtime errors were corrected and future enhancements that could be made to the application.

## Application

The application includes classes with data and logic that map to the UML class diagram provided in the project prompt. The code demonstrates the use of inheritance, abstract and concrete classes, instance and static variables, and instance and static methods.

The Main form includes functionality for managing parts and products, including the ability to add, modify, and delete items. The Add Part and Modify Part forms allow the user to enter data for individual parts, while the Add Product and Modify Product forms allow the user to associate parts with products.

Input validation and logical error checks have been implemented throughout the application, with error messages displayed in the UI to alert the user when issues are detected.

## Running the Application

To run the application, clone the repository and import it into an IDE that supports JavaFX (such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse). Ensure that the JavaFX SDK or module is installed on your machine. Then, run the Main.java file to launch the application.

## Future Enhancements

In future updates, additional functionality could be added to the application to support features such as:

- Saving data to a database or file
- Exporting data to a CSV or other format
- Support for multiple users with different access levels
- Customizable UI themes and layouts
